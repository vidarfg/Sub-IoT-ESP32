# Welcome

Sub-ESP is a project that aims to port the [Sub-IoT](https://sub-iot.github.io/Sub-IoT-Stack/) project over to the ESP32 platform. This repo is a clone of the Sub-IoT with as few changes as possible. Expect that only hardware related parts have been changed from the original repo.

# Collaborators

This is a Bachelor project in collaboration between the student and Danfoss Power Solutions, who suggested this project.
